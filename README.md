# Vidyaroha

This sample app has a tab activity .

 The first tab  greet the user and toast a message like ,
 "hello user , you have entered into the app for the say 11th time today".
The screen  say no of times of visit on day wise basis. 
The second tab  contain two "take picture1" and "take picture2" button ,
onclicking camera  takes picture and show it in the thumbnail as picture1 and picture2 sequentially ,
I am maintaining  the thumbnail view even if we go out app by backpress or kill the instance of the app and again re-open it.

This app has been tested on Redmi 3s prime API 23.
